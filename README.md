# Personal Portfolio Site on Sinatra

### Purpose
The purpose of this site is to display and exercise my current coding skills with Ruby, while also exploring and learning a new framework, Sinatra. I chose this
framework due to it's simplicity, as well as exploring the Rack middleware in a different context than Rails. 

## Learning Goals
One of the big points for me was to explore front-end design with HTML and CSS from the ground up. I've played with HTML and CSS over the years, but never dove in. Having prior code knowledge and understanding the basics, I was able to utilize a clean view pattern utilizing Bootstrap framework with a dash of custom CSS.

## Technology
- Sinatra/ Ruby
- PostgresQL/ActiveRecordSinatra Gem
- RSpec for Testing
